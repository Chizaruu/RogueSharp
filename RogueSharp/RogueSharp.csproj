    <Description>
 A .NET Standard class library providing map generation, path-finding, and field-of-view utilities frequently used in roguelikes or 2D tile based games. Inspired by libtcod

 New features:
   * Map and cell classes now have generic versions that are easier to inherit from.
   * Weighted pool class for randomly picking items.
   * Pathfinder class caches graph and dijkstra result for speedier performance with multiple lookups.
   * Added Map.GetCellsInRectangle method. (Thanks to Andre Odendaal)
   * Improved performance of Pathfinder class up to 75x
   * Added A* shortest path algorithm
 Breaking changes:
   * Bug fix - Change Map.Create to be generic, returning the same map type as the creation strategy's map. (Thanks to Andre Odendaal)
   * Map.Initialize is virtual so that it can be overridden in derived classes
   * Map.Clone is now virtual and generic so that it can be overridden in derived classes.
   * Removed IsInFov from Map and Cell classes (use FieldOfView class instead)
   * Removed IsExplored from Map and Cell classes
   * Multi target .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 6
