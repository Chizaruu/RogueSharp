    New features:
 	* Reworked GoalMap interface to be more consistent with Pathfinder class 
	* Added Path class
	* Bug fixes
    * FxCop clean up
    Breaking changes:
		* Pathfinder now returns Path type instead of IEnumerable
		* GoalMap now returns Path type instead of IEnumerable
		* Map creation algorithms moved to their own namespace
        * DiceNotation "Type" renamed to "TermType" to avoid being a keyword
        * See 3.0 pre-release notes on https://roguesharp.wordpress.com for additional details
