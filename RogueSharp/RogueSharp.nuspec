    New features:
       * Reworked GoalMap interface to be more consistent with Pathfinder class 
       * Added Path class
       * Bug fixes
       * FxCop clean up
    Breaking changes:
       * Pathfinder now returns Path type instead of IEnumerable
       * GoalMap now returns Path type instead of IEnumerable
       * Map creation algorithms moved to their own namespace
       * DiceNotation "Type" renamed to "TermType" to avoid being a keyword
       * Pathfinders can now throw PathNotFoundException
       * See 3.0 release notes on https://roguesharp.wordpress.com for additional details
